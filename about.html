        <p>Hello! I'm Divya Mitra, a dedicated and creative web developer with a passion for building beautiful, responsive websites. My journey into web development began with a deep interest in technology and design, leading me to pursue a career in front-end development.</p>

        <h4>Background & Education</h4>
        <p>I am currently graduating in BCA from Adamas University, where I honed my skills in programming, user interface design, and web technologies. During my studies, I developed a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various front-end frameworks such as Bootstrap.</p>

        <h4>Experience</h4>
        <p>Over the years, I’ve had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects ranging from small personal websites to larger, more complex applications. My experience includes working with clients to bring their ideas to life, ensuring that each project meets their unique needs and expectations.</p>

        <h4>What Drives Me</h4>
        <p>I am passionate about learning and staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends and best practices. I love problem-solving and enjoy the challenge of turning complex requirements into user-friendly interfaces. Whether I'm coding a website from scratch or collaborating with a team, I always strive to deliver high-quality work that not only looks great but also performs efficiently.</p>

        <h4>Beyond Coding</h4>
        <p>When I’m not coding, you can find me in dancing, designing, art and craft. I believe in maintaining a healthy work-life balance and find that my hobbies help me stay creative and inspired.</p>

        <p>If you'd like to learn more about my work or discuss a potential project, feel free to get in touch. I’m always open to new opportunities and collaborations!</p>
